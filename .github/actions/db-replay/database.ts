 * MySQL 8's default authentication needs; the catalogue reads, which alias what
 * they select because the two products answer with the labels in different
 * case; and the dump, whose client has no name both images use.
 *
 * **Four functions below are checked-in copies of dev-config's
 * `.github/actions/db-gate/database.ts` at the pinned SHA**, not independent
 * work: `databaseIn`, `migrate`, `rowsIn` (theirs is `rows`) and `textIn`. An action runs
 * from a checkout with no `node_modules` above it and `.github/` is outside
 * dev-config's `files` allowlist, so there is no import that reaches them —
 * dev-config#69 is where publishing them in a reachable form is argued, and
 * CLAUDE.md's "It only adds" rule carries the carve-out. Each names its own
