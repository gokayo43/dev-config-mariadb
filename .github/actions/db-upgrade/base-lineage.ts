 * A migration lineage as the base ref carried it, and what it takes to put a
 * checkout back onto one for the length of a command.
 *
 * **A checked-in copy of dev-config's `db-gate/base-lineage.ts` at the pinned
 * SHA**, with one delta and nothing else: a problem is a string here rather
 * than their `Problem`, so the `file:` each of theirs carries is folded into
 * the sentence. Nothing in this module is dialect-shaped — it reads git and
 * moves files — which is exactly why it is a copy rather than a rewrite:
 * dev-config#69 is where publishing it in a form this repo could import is
 * argued, and until then a bug fixed there is a bug still here.
 *
 * Its own module because it is its own subject. `upgrade.ts` asks what a
 * history rebuilds; this is how the tree is rolled back to the base ref first,
 * and it is not about that question. The rollback is deliberately narrow and
 * deliberately reversible: the lineage directories are replaced with what the
 * base ref held, a command runs against them, and the branch's own files go
 * back — including when the command throws.
 *
 * The files move rather than the checkout, because the repo's own migrator is
 * the only one there is and it reads the one path it was written to read. A
 * second checkout would mean the commands a repo wraps that migrator in — a
 * worktree's own database, a compose stack — were all answering about the other
 * tree instead of this one.
