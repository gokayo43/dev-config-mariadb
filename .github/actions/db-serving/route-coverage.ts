/**
 * The gate's half of the route-coverage floor. The protocol it reads — the
 * endpoint, the two lists, and why coverage is the difference between two
 * fetches of them rather than a count of one — is `route-log.ts` beside this
 * file, which is dev-config's own module and what the app end imports.
 *
 * What lives here is the reading of that payload and the grading of it, ported
 * from dev-config's `db-gate/route-coverage.ts` at the pinned SHA: the rules
 * are theirs, and a floor that graded a MySQL-family repo more leniently than a
 * Postgres one would be this repo breaking the one rule it exists to keep.
 *
 * **A floor, in the sense the coverage threshold is one:** it catches a route
 * that no load has ever touched, and claims nothing about whether the load that
 * did touch it resembles production. Shipping an endpoint the ramp does not
 * reach is red for the same reason shipping code with no test is.
