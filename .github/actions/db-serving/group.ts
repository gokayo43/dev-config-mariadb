/**
 * A command this job starts and later has to be able to end, and the two halves
 * of that are one fact: **bash only `exec`s a command that is one simple
 * command.** A pipeline, a subshell, a background job or a command that forks a
 * worker of its own leaves children behind when the shell alone is killed, and
 * those children still hold the write end of whatever pipe the shell was
 * writing down — so a reader waiting for the end of that output never sees it.
 *
 * Under `setsid` the shell is a process-group leader, so a kill addressed to the
 * negated pid takes the whole group. Two gates here need exactly that and for
 * two different reasons — a probe that has to be killable inside its bound, and
 * an app that has to be taken down when it never came up — which is why the
 * argument lives here rather than at either of them.
 *
 * `setsid` is util-linux, on every runner this gate targets. A command meaning
 * to leave something running behind it will not: that is the trade a bound is.
 *
 * Killing the group is not the whole of letting go, which is what `capturing`
 * below is for.

 * and the one case this module exists for is the case where the child is gone
 * and something it started is still holding the write end. Measured on the
 * pinned Bun, killing the group and then racing a grace: with the streams owned
 * by a `Response` the process never exits — `unref()` on the subprocess does
 * not change that, and neither does cancelling a `Response`-locked stream —
 * while cancelling the reader below ends it at once.
 *
 * So a gate that bounds a child holds the reader itself. The text promise still
 * resolves after `abandon`, with whatever had arrived.
