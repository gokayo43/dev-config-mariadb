/**
 * The repo's own black-box probe of the app the boot step brought up: a real
 * process making real requests, against a database this job's migrations built
 * and an app that has already answered its health route. Nothing here is
 * stubbed, and nothing here knows what the probe is asserting.
 *
 * It sits between the boot and the ramp because the two floors either side of
 * it cannot ask this question. Health answering 200 proves the app *starts*
 * against that schema; the ramp's route floor proves every route was *reached*.
 * Neither says a single answer was correct — so a migration that applies, boots
 * and serves every route while quietly reinterpreting what a column means
 * passes both. What the probe asserts is the repo's, because only the repo
 * knows what its answers are supposed to be.
 *
 * That makes the contract the smallest one that can carry a claim this gate
 * cannot read: **stdout is the verdict.** Every line the command writes there
 * is one problem, whatever it exits with, and a command that exits non-zero
 * having written nothing is a failure the gate has to word for itself.
 *
 * Stdout rather than the exit status, because the status is the half a probe
 * gets wrong. A runner that collects failures and reports them at the end, a
 * shell function whose last command happened to succeed, a `set +e` somebody
 * added while debugging: each of those prints exactly what is broken and then
 * exits 0. Reading the status first would make this gate's answer depend on the
 * one thing about a repo's own program it cannot see, and the failure mode is
 * silence over an app that said out loud what was wrong with it.
 *
 * `capacity-script` hands a repo the same authorship one step later, and for
 * the same reason — the gate owns the running, the repo owns the meaning.
 *
 * **This is dev-config's `db-gate/probe.ts` at the pinned SHA**, ported rather
 * than reached for: an action runs from a checkout with no `node_modules` above
 * it, which is the carve-out CLAUDE.md carries and dev-config#69 is where
 * ending it is argued. The contract above is theirs and is not this repo's to
 * soften. Deltas, none of them about the rule:
 *   * problems are text rather than their `Problem`, which is
 *     `annotations.ts`'s delta followed through;
 *   * `setsid` and the group kill live in `group.ts`, because the boot step
 *     needs the same two and the argument for them is one argument;
 *   * their `appUrlFrom` is gone. `boot.ts` refuses an empty or unparseable
 *     `health-url` before any app is started, and this step runs only once the
 *     app has answered at that URL — a second refusal here would be a branch no
 *     input reaches.
