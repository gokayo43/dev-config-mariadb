/**
 * What an allowlist input is, for every gate here that has one: the entries a
 * gate compares against, plus what is wrong with the input itself.
 *
 * **This is a checked-in copy of the allowlist half of dev-config's
 * `.github/actions/_lib/gate.ts` at the pinned SHA** — `REASON`, `entriesIn`,
 * `Allowlist`, `allowlistFrom` and `deadEntries`, theirs with the one delta
 * named below. It is a copy for the reason `annotations.ts` gives at length:
 * an action runs from a checkout with no `node_modules` above it, and
 * `.github/` sits outside dev-config's `files` allowlist, so there is no import
 * that reaches the original. dev-config#69 is where publishing it in a
 * reachable form is argued, and CLAUDE.md's "It only adds" rule carries the
 * carve-out that lets this file exist. A bug fixed there is a bug still here
 * until somebody carries it over.
 *
 * Deltas from upstream, both about what this repo has rather than about the
 * rule:
 *   * a problem is a plain string rather than their `Problem`, the same delta
 *     `annotations.ts` carries and for the same reason: every problem this
 *     repo's gates raise is about a database rather than about a line of the
 *     tree, and `file=`/`line=` on an annotation pointing at nothing is dropped
 *     by GitHub in silence.
 *   * the lists are `readonly`. Nothing here mutates one, and the two gates
 *     reading them — the DATETIME allowlist and the route floor — differ in
 *     what an entry IS, which is exactly the reason neither may edit the other's
 *     copy of it.

 * not — an entry there is parsed into a method and a path first, and `options
 * /*` and `OPTIONS /*` are one route rather than two spellings — so it
 * classifies its own in `route-coverage.ts`, which is where the parse that
 * makes it different lives.
 *
 * `live` is what the gate still grades: a subject in it is a waiver doing its
 * job. `known` is everything the gate can see at all, and the difference
 * between the two is the difference between an entry to drop and a name to fix
 * — sending the first case name-hunting is how a retired rule costs every
 * consumer an afternoon.
 *
 * An entry with no reason is asked none of this: its author is going back to
 * that line regardless, and one mistake earns one diagnostic.
