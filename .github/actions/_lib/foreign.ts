/**
 * A document nobody here wrote, read one key at a time.
 *
 * Everything the gates in this repo grade is foreign: another repo's
 * `package.json`, a workflow's YAML, a row a server answered with. None of it
 * has a schema this repo can hold — the keys are whatever that repo wrote, and
 * a modelled type would have to be every valid and invalid one of them at once
 * while claiming exactly what has not been checked yet.
 *
 * So the shape is refused at the read instead, and every gate goes through
 * these five rather than restating the narrowing. The alias below is the one
 * escape hatch in the tree, in the one module whose job is to hold it.
 *
 * **This is a checked-in copy of the narrowing half of dev-config's
 * `.github/actions/_lib/gate.ts` at the pinned SHA**, for the reason
 * `annotations.ts` gives at length and CLAUDE.md carries as a carve-out: an
 * action runs from a checkout with no node_modules above it, so there is no
 * import that reaches the original. dev-config#69 is where ending that is
 * argued.
 *
 * Deltas from upstream, all cosmetic — nothing here behaves differently:
 *   * `Foreign` is their `ConfigObject`, under a name that says whose document
 *     it is rather than what kind of file it came from, since this repo reads
 *     database rows through it as well as configs.
 *   * `isForeign` is their `isObject`, renamed to match.
 *   * `kindOf` says "a list" where theirs says "an array", because every
 *     diagnostic here that uses it is about a query answer or a YAML node.
 *   * `mapAt` and `textAt` are this repo's own: upstream reads fields through
 *     `record()` at each call site, and two readers here descend several levels
 *     of a document at a time.
 *   * `isList` is theirs verbatim, docblock included.
