// oxlint-disable no-console -- stdout is the protocol: GitHub reads ::error and ::notice lines off it
//
// What a gate under .github/actions writes to the log, what it publishes to the
// run summary, and how a step ends — plus the environment a child whose output
// a gate then reads is given, which is the same protocol seen from the far end.
// GitHub checks the whole repository out to run an action, so a gate may import
// across action directories; only the directory named in `uses:` is the action.
//
// **This is a checked-in copy of dev-config's `.github/actions/_lib/gate.ts` at
// the pinned SHA**, cut down to what the gates here write. `inputs` and
// `required` are theirs verbatim; `commanded`, `publish` and `entry` are theirs
// with the deltas named below. It is a copy because there is no import that
// could reach the original: an action runs from a checkout with no node_modules
// above it, and `.github/` sits outside dev-config's `files` allowlist, so the
// only copy on disk anywhere is in a consuming repo's workspace rather than in
// the action's. dev-config#69 is where publishing it in a reachable form is
// argued; CLAUDE.md's "It only adds" rule carries the carve-out that lets this
// file exist. A bug fixed there is a bug still here until somebody carries it
// over — and one of them has already been fixed here and not there, see `entry`.
//
// Deltas from upstream, all deliberate:
//   * `Verdict.problems` is `readonly string[]` rather than their `Problem[]`.
//     Every problem this repo's gates raise is about a database rather than
//     about a line of the tree, and `file=`/`line=` on an annotation that
//     pointed at nothing would be dropped by GitHub in silence.
//   * `entry` escapes the caught error — see there.
//   * `publish` relays the log through `relay` rather than printing it — see
//     there. Upstream prints it raw, which is dev-config#71's second half.

 * return is ONE line to a split on `\n` — so it takes one margin, at the front
 * — and TWO lines to the runner, the second beginning wherever the author put
 * the `\r`. `select 'x\r::stop-commands::…'` is such a line, and MariaDB will
 * produce it: a routine, trigger or view body is stored and re-dumped as source
 * text, so a bare carriage return anywhere in one survives into the dump
 * verbatim.
 *
 * A column `DEFAULT` or `COMMENT` will not, and that is the road not to walk
 * back down: `mariadb-dump` escapes a carriage return inside a string literal
 * as the two characters `\r`. Only the source-text paths carry the raw byte,
