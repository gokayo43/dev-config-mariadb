/**
 * The one checked-in copy in this repo whose original is reachable from
 * somewhere, and this is that somewhere.
 *
 * `route-log.ts` under `.github/actions` is a copy for the reason every copy
 * here is one — an action runs from a checkout with no `node_modules` above it
 * — but unlike `annotations.ts` and `foreign.ts`, dev-config publishes this one:
 * it is in their `files` allowlist as `@gokayo43/dev-config/route-log.ts`,
 * because the app end of the contract imports it. A test resolves node_modules
 * normally, so the two ends can be held together here.
 *
 * A protocol whose two ends disagree is a floor grading a payload nobody sends.
 * The strings are compared at runtime; the three shapes are compared by the
 * assignments below, each of which the typechecker refuses if either side has
 * grown, lost or changed a field.
