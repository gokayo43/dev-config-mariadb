/**
 * An app for the boot, probe and ramp suites to run against: a real process,
 * started the way a consuming repo's `start-command` starts one, serving a
 * health route, a couple of ordinary routes and the counter endpoint the
 * coverage floor reads.
 *
 * It imports the protocol from **dev-config's own `route-log.ts`**, which is
 * what a consuming app imports — the export exists so that neither end of the
 * contract reproduces it from memory. So what these suites drive the gate
 * against is a payload built from the published protocol rather than one this
 * repo wrote to match its own reader.
 *
 * `APP_MODE` is how a case asks for the app that is not fine. Each of the three
 * is a real failure a consuming repo has: a process that dies on the way up
 * because the schema is not what it expected, one that accepts connections and
 * never answers, and one that serves everything except the instrument.
