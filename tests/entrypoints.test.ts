 * Every other suite here drives a gate's function and reads the `Verdict` it
 * answered with. That is the right subject for what a gate *decides* — and it
 * is blind to the one thing a step must also do, which is **end**. A gate whose
 * verdict is perfect and whose process never exits is a step that hangs until
 * the job's timeout with every later step skipped, and the suite that graded
 * the verdict is green.
 *
 * So each entry point is spawned as a process, under a wall clock, and the
 * assertion is that it came back. What it exited with is asserted where the
 * case knows; that it exited at all is asserted every time.
