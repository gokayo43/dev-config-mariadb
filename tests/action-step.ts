/**
 * A shipped action step, run the way the runner runs it — the step's own `run:`
 * block, in the working directory it declares, under the environment the runner
 * would have built.
 *
 * What this exists for is the class of failure no in-process test can see: a
 * gate runs inside the job of the repository it grades, after that repo's
 * install scripts, build and migrator have each had a turn, and each of those
 * can write `$GITHUB_ENV`/`$GITHUB_PATH` — folded into every later step — or
 * leave a file in the checkout that the gate's own interpreter reads on the way
 * up. All of them end the same way: the step green, having graded nothing.
 *
 * The step is extracted from the shipped `action.yml` and run, never
 * transcribed — the reason `refusals.test.ts` gives for the wrapper's own
 * block. A transcription would grade a copy that cannot go stale, which is the
 * opposite of the property wanted.
 *
 * Both suites that drive shipped steps come through here: `action-steps.test.ts`
 * for the replay and DATETIME gates, `serving-steps.test.ts` for the three the
 * serving gate ships.
