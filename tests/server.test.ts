 * and answering, and the runner is no longer the thing that decided that.
 *
 * A service container is health-checked by the runner, which refuses to start
 * the job's steps until it passes. A step is not: it says the server is up, and
 * every gate after it believes that. So the cases below are the ways it could
 * say so wrongly — a server that never answers, a container that came up and
 * died, a name a previous run left behind — and each asserts the failure
 * surfaces rather than the job carrying on into a gate that will report a
 * refused connection as if it were a fact about the graded repo.
