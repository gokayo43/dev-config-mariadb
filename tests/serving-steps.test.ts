/**
 * What the shipped serving steps do when the repository they are grading has
 * already had a turn.
 *
 * Each of these steps runs inside that repo's job, after its install scripts,
 * its build and its migrator. Two things they used to take from their
 * surroundings were that repo's to rewrite, and both ended the same way — the
 * step green, having graded nothing:
 *
 * - the working directory was the graded checkout, and `bun` runs a top-level
 *   `preload` from the `bunfig.toml` it finds there before the file it was
 *   given. `process.exit(0)` in that preload ends the step at zero. No
 *   hostility is needed: a legitimate preload injects the same way, and this
 *   very repo declares one under `[test]`;
 * - the interpreter came from a PATH the same steps can prepend to through
 *   `$GITHUB_PATH`, which replaces the gate with a program that exits 0.
 *
 * A green step is therefore the failure in every case here, never the
 * expectation: each asserts the gate's own refusal, which is the proof its code
 * ran at all.
