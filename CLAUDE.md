# dev-config-mariadb

The MariaDB extension of `gokayo43/dev-config`, for the two legacy repos whose
database is MariaDB. `CONTEXT.md` is the vocabulary; `README.md` is the
reference for how a consumer calls this workflow and what each job does.

## Canon

The house rules live outside this repo and win over anything here:
`~/claude-shared/STACK.md`, `architecture.md`, `testing.md`, `principles.md`.
dev-config is where most of them are already executable — this repo adds the one
thing that could not live there.

## The rule this repo exists to keep

**It only adds.** No gate here loosens one of theirs, and the static half is a
call rather than a fork. A change that would be better made in dev-config is
made in dev-config: this repo is for what is MariaDB-shaped and nothing else.
Anything that reads as "the base should have this too" is an issue there, not a
second implementation here.

**The one carve-out: the gate library.** A composite action runs from a checkout
of its own repo with no `node_modules` above it, and `.github/` is outside
dev-config's `files` allowlist — so nothing under `.github/actions/` here can
import from the dev-config this repo installs, by any route. Several files
therefore carry checked-in copies of theirs at the pinned SHA, and each says so
in its own header with its deltas named: `_lib/annotations.ts` (the writing half
of their `_lib/gate.ts`), `_lib/foreign.ts` (its narrowing half),
`_lib/allowlist.ts` (its `-- why` half), the four functions
`db-replay/database.ts` names (`databaseIn`, `migrate`, `rowsIn`, `textIn`), and what the
serving gate ports — `db-serving/probe.ts`, `route-coverage.ts`, `capacity.ts`,
`route-log.ts` and the k6 script `ramp.js`.
[dev-config#69](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config/issues/69) is where
ending that is argued.

One of those copies is not blind, and it is the shape the rest could take.
`route-log.ts` is a protocol both ends of a contract need, so dev-config
publishes it — it is in their `files` allowlist, and a consuming app imports it.
A **test** resolves `node_modules` normally even though an action cannot, so
`tests/route-log.test.ts` holds this repo's copy to dev-config's own module and
fails when either end drifts. The other copies have no published original to be
held to; `.github/` reaches this repo's install only because a `github:`
dependency is a full checkout.

The carve-out is for what the runtime makes unreachable, and nothing else. It is
not licence to fork a gate: an assertion, a diagnostic or a rule that could live
in dev-config still belongs there. And it cuts both ways — a bug fixed there is
a bug still here until somebody carries it over, and two fixes have so far gone
the other way ([dev-config#70](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config/issues/70),
[#71](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config/issues/71)), which is why a copy
that has been improved says so at the line that improved it.

## Layout

- `.github/workflows/check.yml` — the wrapper consumers call. Three jobs: the
  call into dev-config's `check.yml` with `database: false`, the always-running
  `refusals` job that fails a call asking for a database-job input without the
  job, and `database`, which is every MariaDB gate this repo has — one job, and
  CONTEXT.md's entry for the term says why there will stay one. Every gate step
  in it is handed the database and the interpreter by a step that reads them at
  the top of that job, before a line of the graded repo's own code has run, and
  the search path too wherever the step resolves a program by name. `#2`, `#3`
  and `#5` are shipped; `#4` and `#6` land as further steps of it, each with the
  composite action that runs it, its own suite, and its page under `docs/gates/`
  — the shape dev-config's "Adding a gate" describes.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — this repo's own gate, which is dev-config's
  `check.yml` called directly. It cannot be the wrapper: a commit cannot pin its
  own SHA, so the wrapper's pin is always one commit behind whatever is under
  review.
- `.github/actions/` — the gates themselves, each a `<name>.ts` the suite drives
  and a `<name>.main.ts` the action runs. Three directories, all steps of the
  one database job: `db-replay` (`#2`), `db-datetime` (`#5`) and `db-serving`
  (`#3`, the boot, probe and ramp). Each splits what talks to something from
  what is pure, so that a verdict can be driven without the thing under it —
  `db-replay/database.ts` and `db-replay/schema.ts`, `db-serving/ramp.ts` and
  `db-serving/capacity.ts`; `db-datetime` reads its catalogue through the first
  of those and opens no connection of its own. `_lib/` is what every action
  shares: `annotations.ts` (the log protocol and the run summary), `foreign.ts`
  (the one place a document nobody here wrote is narrowed), `allowlist.ts` (how
  an allowlist input is read, what a reason costs, and what a dead entry costs)
  and `gate.sh` (how every gate step starts its own program).
- **A gate step takes nothing from the repository it grades.** It runs in the
  action's own checkout — `bun` reads a `bunfig.toml` `preload` from its working
  directory, and a graded repo's is not the gate's to run — under an interpreter
  and, where it resolves a program by name, a search path that the calling job
  read before that repo's install scripts, build or migrator could rewrite
  either. `check.yml`'s `pinned` step is where they are read, `_lib/gate.sh` is
  where they are refused when empty and where the rule about which steps need
  which is written, and the project reaches the gate as a path rather than as
  the place it was run. Anything a new gate resolves by name — a binary, a
  config, a database URL — belongs on that list.
- The evidence artifact belongs to the **job**, not to either action — the
  upload step in `check.yml` says why, and is where `db-gate-evidence` is read.
  What that costs a new gate: a file it leaves in the runner goes on that step's
  `path`, and `tests/serving-job.test.ts` fails when one does not.
- `tests/` — what CI cannot see from outside. `wrapper-inputs.test.ts` grades
  the wrapper and the README against the dev-config in `node_modules`, which is
  the commit the workflows call: every input the wrapper hands on reaches the
  call under its own name, every input it declares is read by something and is
  declared with dev-config's own type and default, nothing is forwarded that
  dev-config does not declare, the call carries exactly one literal and it is
  `database: false`, only one job calls that workflow at all, what the README
  tables and what it says is refused cover dev-config's input surface exactly,
  the four carriers of the dev-config pin agree, every action pin names a commit
  this repo carries AND one whose `.github/actions` is the tree here now, and
  the server image is written once as far as a reader is concerned.
  `refusals.test.ts` runs the wrapper's own `run:` block — extracted from the
  shipped YAML rather than transcribed, with the environment derived from its
  own `env:` block — over the whole truth table of the rule this workflow adds.
  `serving-job.test.ts` grades the wiring no gate can see from inside: which
  steps the job runs, what the app is given, whether every file a step leaves in
  the runner is actually uploaded, and that every step declares the pins above.
  `action-steps.test.ts` and `serving-steps.test.ts` run the shipped `run:`
  blocks against a checkout that fights back — a `bunfig.toml` preloading its
  own code, a `DATABASE_URL` naming a database of its own, a `bun` or a `docker`
  of its own first on PATH — both through the one harness in `action-step.ts`.
  `entrypoints.test.ts` is the lane that runs what GitHub runs: every
  `*.main.ts` as a process, under a wall clock, asserting it **ends** — the
  property no in-process test can see, and the one a gate that starts a
  long-lived app gets wrong. The rest of the suite drives the gates against the
  real thing — MariaDB containers it starts and removes itself, and a real app
  process on a real port — which is why `ci.yml` sets `test-network`.

  The one thing the suite cannot run has a job of its own in `ci.yml`: nothing
  in `bun test` may fetch a binary, so the shipped k6 ramp is executed by
  `tests/ramp-script.ts` under the pinned k6 that `k6.sh` fetches. "It runs
  inside k6" is why the linter and knip skip that script, and it is not a reason
  for nothing to have run it.

## The server this repo is written against

MariaDB 11.4, because that is what `nfp-elysia` runs (probed: `11.4.12-MariaDB`).
`wmstcs`, the other repo `README.md` names, runs **MySQL 8.0.32** — same dialect
family, different server, and a different dump client binary. There is no lane
for it and the pinned image refuses it;
[#9](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config-mariadb/issues/9) is that decision,
and it is blocked on [dev-config#68](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config/issues/68),
which is why the obvious fix — a `db-image` input — could not be written.

## Moving the dev-config pin

Four files carry it — both workflows, `package.json` and `bun.lock` — and the
suite requires all four to name one commit: a repo gated by one dev-config,
shipping another and grading its own wrapper against a third has no answer about
any of them. Renovate raises the bump as a PR (`renovate.json` extends
dev-config's preset, which keeps that pin off automerge); the tag in the trailing
comment moves with the SHA, and `bun install` is part of adopting it.

Renovate reaches the manifest through a different oracle than the workflows —
digest against dev-config's default branch, tag for the two `uses:` — so a bump
raised while dev-config's `main` sits ahead of its latest tag arrives with the
carriers disagreeing, and the suite fails on that PR. Point all four at the
tagged commit by hand when it happens.
[#8](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config-mariadb/issues/8) is the decision
about ending that, including why the obvious fix — a tag in the manifest — is
refused by dev-config's own contract.

## Releasing an action

A commit cannot reference its own SHA, and inside a called workflow a relative
`uses:` resolves against the **caller's** checkout — so the wrapper reaches this
repo's actions by full path and SHA, and an action and the workflow pinning it
are two commits. dev-config carries the same shape; `check.yml` there is v0.50.1
pinning actions at v0.50.0.

Two consequences, both live from the first action this repo shipped:

- **A change to an action is two commits**, the second re-pinning the first.
  `tests/wrapper-inputs.test.ts` fails when a pin names a commit this repo does
  not carry, and when it names one whose actions are no longer the actions here
  — a pin that resolves but ships something else is the half nobody notices.
- **The pinned commit has to survive.** A squash merge orphans it, and an
  orphaned pin is an action GitHub cannot fetch — a database job that fails for
  every consumer at once. Tagging the release is what keeps it reachable, and
  until this repo has a release, merging without squashing is what stands in.

## Commands

```sh
bun run check   # format:check + lint + typecheck + knip
bun test
```

## Adoption

Neither consumer calls this workflow yet: `wmstcs` is a pnpm/Node repo and
`nfp-elysia` has no CI workflow at all, so both need the fleet scaffold before
the wrapper is worth pointing at. Two things in dev-config's repo contract
refuse a consumer of this workflow on facts that are about dev-config's own
Postgres job rather than about the repo —
[dev-config#65](https://github.com/gokayo43/dev-config/issues/65) carries both,
and `README.md`'s call example carries the `ci-call` exemption that is the
answer until it lands.
